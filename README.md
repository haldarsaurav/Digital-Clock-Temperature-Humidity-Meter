# Digital-Clock-Temperature-Humidity-Meter

<ul>
  <li>Here in this porject I designed and produced a clock that can show the date, month, year, time, temperature, and humidity.</li>
  <li>I used and earned and designed using code written in C/C++ coded in Arduino IDE, using hardware such as ATMEGA328 as the primary IC, RTC DS3231 for clocking, Sensors DHT11 for humidity sensing, LM35 and my tempaerature sensor, and Voltage Regulator 7805.</li>
  <li>For the final build used Eagle CAD Software and Fritzing for PCB design.</li>
  <li>Designed wooden casing/enclosure for final presentation in AutoCAD for a completed end-user product, which I personally used as my desk clock and climate monitor</li>
</ul>  
  
## How the final desk clock looks :)
